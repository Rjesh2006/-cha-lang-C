## Linked List Node Data Viewer and Finder:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};

void find1(struct node *find, struct node *head) {
    if (head == find)
        printf("%d", head->data);

    while (head != NULL && head != find)
        head = head->next;

    if (head != NULL)
        printf("%d", head->data);
}

void view(struct node *head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%d ", head->data);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    struct node head;
    struct node *first, *second, *third, *forth;

    first = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    second = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    third = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    forth = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));

    head.data = 0;
    head.next = first;

    first->data = 10;
    first->next = second; 

    second->data = 20;
    second->next = third;

    third->data = 30;
    third->next = forth;
    
    forth->data = 40;
    forth->next = NULL;

    view(head.next);
    find1(third, head.next);

    free(first);
    free(second);
    free(third);
    free(forth);

    first = second = third = forth = NULL;
    head.next = NULL;
    return 0;
}
```


**Explanation:**
The program defines a structure node representing a single node in a linked list, containing an integer data and a pointer next.
Two functions are defined: find1 to search for a node by its address and print its data, and view to traverse and print the data of all nodes in the linked list.
Memory is allocated for four nodes (first, second, third, and forth) to create a linked list.
Data values are assigned to each node to create a linked list (10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40).
The view function prints the original linked list.
The find1 function is called to find and print the data of a specific node (third).
Memory allocated for the nodes is freed to prevent memory leaks, and pointers are set to NULL to avoid dangling pointers.
