***Constants***:

- Constants are values that do not change during the execution of a program.
- They are used to represent fixed values that remain constant throughout the program.

**Using `const` Keyword**:
- In C++, constants are typically defined using the `const` keyword.
- This keyword tells the compiler that the value of the variable cannot be modified.

**Declaring Constants**:
- Constants can be declared and initialized in one step.
- Once assigned a value, a constant cannot be changed.

```cpp
const int MAX_SIZE = 100;
const float PI = 3.14159;
```

**Benefits of Constants**:
- Constants make your code more readable by giving meaningful names to fixed values.
- They help prevent accidental changes to important values, improving code reliability.

**Using Constants in Expressions**:
- Constants can be used in expressions just like variables.
- They provide a way to avoid using "magic numbers" (hard-coded numerical values) in your code.

```cpp
const int LENGTH = 2 * MAX_SIZE;
```

**Scope of Constants**:
- Constants declared at the global level (outside of functions) have file scope.
- They can be accessed from anywhere in the file.

```cpp
// Global constant
const int GLOBAL_CONSTANT = 50;

int main() {
    // Accessing global constant
    int value = GLOBAL_CONSTANT;
    return 0;
}
```

**Constants and Data Types**:
- Constants can be of any data type, such as int, float, char, etc.
- They follow the same rules as variables regarding data type compatibility.

```cpp
const char GRADE = 'A';
const std::string MESSAGE = "Hello, World!";
```

Constants provide a way to make your code more understandable and maintainable by giving names to values that are not meant to change. They are a fundamental concept in programming and are widely used in C++.
