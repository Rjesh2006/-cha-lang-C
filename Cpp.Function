    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}'''
If we call factorial(5), the function will be called recursively with arguments 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. After the base case is reached (n == 1), the function returns, and the previous function calls can complete their calculations. Each function call adds a new frame to the call stack, and when the base case is reached, the stack begins to unwind as each function returns its result.

Understanding recursion depth is crucial for writing efficient and safe recursive functions. It's important to consider the potential number of recursive calls and ensure that the function doesn't exceed the available memory on the call stack.

## Function Definition:

A function definition in C++ specifies what the function does. It includes the return type, function name, parameters (if any), and the body of the function.

```cpp
// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
Function Declaration:
A function declaration informs the compiler about the function name, return type, and parameters. It doesn't contain the function body.


// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);
Function Call:
To execute a function, you need to call it by its name and provide the necessary arguments (if any). The function call invokes the function's code.


int result = add(5, 3); // Calling the add function
Return Type:
Functions may return a value of a specific data type using the return statement. If a function doesn't return a value, its return type is void.


int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b; // Return type is int
}

void greet() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
}
Parameters:
Parameters are variables declared in a function's signature that receive values passed during the function call. They enable passing data to functions.

cpp
Copy code
// Function with parameters
void display(int num) {
    cout << "The number is: " << num << endl;
}
Default Arguments:
Default arguments are values assigned to parameters during function declaration. If no value is provided during the function call, the default value is used.

cpp
Copy code
// Function with default argument
void greet(string name = "Guest") {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
}
Function Overloading:
Function overloading allows defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists. The compiler resolves the appropriate function based on the context of the call.

cpp
Copy code
// Function overloading
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

float add(float a, float b) {
    return a + b;
}
Recursive Functions:
A recursive function is a function that calls itself either directly or indirectly. Recursive functions are useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

cpp
Copy code
// Recursive function to calculate factorial
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
Recursion Explanation:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It breaks down a complex problem into simpler subproblems and solves each subproblem independently until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns its result back up the call stack.

Example of Recursion: Factorial Function:
The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial function can be defined recursively.

cpp
Copy code
// Recursive function to calculate factorial
int factorial(int n) {
    // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    // Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
